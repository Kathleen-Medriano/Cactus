Notes from:

main.py

To do:
- imagine code organization
    - what to do with adjacency matrix? (i want to generalize its creation)
    - then i want to save adjacency along with the sillhouette creation (like a run tag/id)
- develop simple model 
    - do I want this model to learn just one adjacency matrix? 
    - oh an interesting thing: learn how to learn adjacency matrix???

Goal is to finish this two, Saturday night??


This is wrong!

    # main thing to consider, should i treat "solution_array" as an ordered sequence where the order informs which is connected to each other?
    # I'm assuming the ordered sequence since that's how the stimulus generation was designed

Remember what Misi said: there are always two of you the EXPERIMENTER and the MODELER, the experimenter has access to this knowledge, the MODELER knows that the agent does not have this knowledge
